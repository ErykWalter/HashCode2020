My solution was to use some kind of lacal search, because finding quite good order of libraries is quite easy, I decided to randomize order of sending books by selecting random 5 of themand then shuffling their order of sending books.<br>
<br>
Project info:<br>
python version: 3.10.8<br>
used libraries:<br>
1. random<br>
2. time<br>

To run a program you I recommend use a command (if you are a linux user): <br>
`cat file.txt | ./main.py`
