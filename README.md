My solution was to use some kind of lacal search, because finding quite good order of libraries is quite easy, I decided to randomize order of sending books by selecting random 5 of themand then shuffling their order of sending books.

Project info:
python version: 3.10.8
used libraries:
	1. random
	2. time
To run a program you I recommend use a command (if you are a linux user):
cat file.txt | ./main.py
